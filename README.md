ASSIGNMENT LAB 1

I built this portfolio as my first online resume. It's a simple, single static HTML file.

I used semantic HTML tags to organize everything clearly:

The Header has the title and a navigation bar (<nav>).

The Main content is split into different sections (<section>):

About Me: My bio and profile picture.

Technical Proficiency: A table listing my skills, like Python (Advanced).

Projects: Details on things I've built, like the Student Registration System (Python + SQL).

Contact Me: Includes a working contact form.

The Footer has a useful "Back to Top" link.

The main goal is to be a professional, organized online showcase of my early technical skills and development projects.
