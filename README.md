ASSIGNMENT- LAB 1
I built this portfolio as my first online resume to clearly present my skills and projects as a first-year CSE student. It’s constructed using a single, organized static HTML file.
I used semantic HTML5 elements to make the structure intuitive and easy to navigate:
The <header> holds the title and my main navigation bar (<nav>) so you can instantly jump to any part of the site (About, Projects, Skills, Contact).
All the core content lives inside the <main> area, broken down into logical <section> elements:
I introduce myself and include my profile picture.
There's a table in the Technical Proficiency section listing the programming languages I know (like Python, HTML, and Java).
The Projects section details the things I've built, such as my Student Registration System (Python + SQL).
A simple contact form is available in the Contact Me section.
The <footer> just has a handy "Back to Top" link.
The main purpose of this project is to be a professional, well-organized digital showcase of my foundational coding work and ongoing learning journey.
