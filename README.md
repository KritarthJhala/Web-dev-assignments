ASSIGNMENT LAB 1

I built this portfolio as my first online resume. It's a simple, single static HTML file.

I used semantic HTML tags to organize everything clearly:

The Header has the title and a navigation bar (nav).

The Main content is split into different sections (section):

About Me: My bio and profile picture.

Technical Proficiency: A table listing my skills

Projects: Details on projects I've built.

Contact Me: Includes a working contact form.

The Footer has a useful "Back to Top" link.

The main goal is to be a professional, organized online showcase of my early technical skills and development projects.
