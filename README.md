ASSIGNMENT LAB 1

I built this portfolio as my first online resume. It's a simple, single static HTML file.

I used semantic HTML tags to organize everything clearly:

The Header has the title and a navigation bar (nav).

The Main content is split into different sections (section):

About Me: My bio and profile picture.

Technical Proficiency: A table listing my skills

Projects: Details on projects I've built.

Contact Me: Includes a working contact form.

The Footer has a useful "Back to Top" link.

The main goal is to be a professional, organized online showcase of my early technical skills and development projects.

ASSIGNMENT LAB 2

This is the next version of my portfolio, now including a separate style.css file for design and polish.

I made several structural and aesthetic improvements:

External Styling: The presentation is now managed by a separate style.css file, which is linked in the HTML.

Styled Sections: All main sections (section) are styled with a white background, rounded corners, and padding to stand out against the light blue body.

Visual Enhancements:

The navigation bar is styled with the primary blue color.

The profile photo is now circular and has a shadow effect.

The skills table and project cards are visually cleaner and better contained.

The contact form is centered and clearly styled for better user experience.

The core purpose remains to serve as a professional, well-organized digital showcase of my foundational coding work, but it now has a significantly cleaner and more responsive design using the external CSS.
